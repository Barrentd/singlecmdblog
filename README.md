# SingleCmdBlog

> Write it, build it, ship it

## What is this?

SingleCmdBlog is a ridiculously simple static blog generator that fits in a single Python file. No databases, no PHP nightmares, no "oops I broke my site by updating a plugin" moments.

**Features:**

- Write in Markdown (like a civilized human)
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Categories
- Mobile-friendly (your mom can read it on her phone)
- Fast as lightning (14KB page limit enforced!)
- Zero dependencies (well, Python... but that's it!)

## Quick Start

**The "I want it NOW" way:**

### 1. Write some content in content/my-first-post.md

```markdown
---
title: My First Post
date: 2024-01-01
categories: blog, thoughts
---

This is easier than assembling IKEA furniture.
```

### 2. Build the site

```bash
python3 build.py
```

### 3. Serve it locally (because we live dangerously)

```bash
python3 build.py --serve
```

Open http://localhost:8080 and boom üí• You have a blog.

## Docker Way (for the cool kids)

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t singlecmdblog .

# Run it (your blog will live at http://localhost:8080)
docker run -p 8080:80 singlecmdblog

# Feel superior to WordPress users
```

## File Structure

```bash
tinyblog/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.py          # The magic happens here ‚ú®
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/          # Your brilliant thoughts go here
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hello.md      # Example post
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ about.md      # Tell the world who you are
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/           # Static files (images, etc.)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build/            # Generated site (don't touch, it bites)
```

## Writing Posts

Create a `.md` file in `content/`. Start with some front matter (fancy name for metadata):

```markdown
---
title: Why Cats Rule the Internet
date: 2024-01-15
categories: cats, philosophy, internet
---

# Your brilliant content here

Cats are basically tiny furry overlords...
```

**Pro tips:**

- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Categories: comma-separated (spaces optional, life is short)
- Pages: add `page: true` to front matter for non-blog pages

## Customization

- **Site config:** Edit the variables at the top of `build.py`
- **Theme:** CSS is embedded (because external files are overrated)
- **Colors:** Dark theme uses CSS variables (look for `:root`)

## Deployment

**Static hosting (recommended):**

- Netlify: drag & drop the `build/` folder
- GitHub Pages: push `build/` contents
- Any web server: upload `build/` contents

**Or use the Docker image** (because containers solve everything):

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 tinyblog
```

## Size Limits (because nobody likes slow sites)

- **Index page:** 14KB max (warning if exceeded)
- **Article pages:** 30KB max (warning if exceeded)
- **Other pages:** 14KB max (warning if exceeded)

*If you hit these limits, maybe consider splitting your novel into chapters* üòâ
